# src/lib/utils.ts

## Overview

This code provides a set of functions for working with files and directories in Node.js. It includes functions for checking if a file is ASCII, opening a file, looking up the contents of a .gitignore file, looking up the contents of a .aiignore file, determining if a file should be ignored based on specified rules, and processing an array of file paths.

## Additional Info

### Installation and Setup

To use this code, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js installed, you can use the following steps to set up the code:

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory you created.
3. Run the command `npm init` to initialize a new Node.js project.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`.

### Dependencies

This code has the following dependencies:

- `node:fs/promises`: This is a built-in Node.js module for working with the file system.
- `node:path`: This is a built-in Node.js module for working with file paths.

### Functions

This code defines the following functions:

#### `isFileAscii(filePath: string): Promise<boolean>`

This function checks if a file is ASCII. It accepts a `filePath` parameter, which is the path to the file. It returns a promise that resolves to a boolean value indicating whether the file is ASCII or not.

Usage example:

```typescript
const isAscii = await isFileAscii('path/to/file.txt');
console.log(isAscii); // true or false
```

#### `openFilePath(filePath: string): Promise<number>`

This function opens a file. It accepts a `filePath` parameter, which is the path to the file. It returns a promise that resolves to a file descriptor.

Usage example:

```typescript
const file = await openFilePath('path/to/file.txt');
console.log(file); // file descriptor
```

#### `lookupGitIgnoreContents(): Promise<string[]>`

This function looks up the contents of a .gitignore file. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of strings representing the non-comment lines in the .gitignore file.

Usage example:

```typescript
const gitIgnoreContents = await lookupGitIgnoreContents();
console.log(gitIgnoreContents); // array of strings
```

#### `lookupAiIgnoreContents(): Promise<string[]>`

This function looks up the contents of a .aiignore file. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of strings representing the non-comment lines in the .aiignore file.

Usage example:

```typescript
const aiIgnoreContents = await lookupAiIgnoreContents();
console.log(aiIgnoreContents); // array of strings
```

#### `shouldIgnoreFile(file: string, options: any): Promise<boolean>`

This function determines if a file should be ignored based on specified rules. It accepts a `file` parameter, which is the path to the file, and an `options` parameter, which is an object containing optional parameters. It returns a promise that resolves to a boolean value indicating whether the file should be ignored or not.

Usage example:

```typescript
const shouldIgnore = await shouldIgnoreFile('path/to/file.txt', { gitIgnoreContents: [], aiIgnoreContents: [], ignore: [] });
console.log(shouldIgnore); // true or false
```

#### `processPathArray(pathArray: string[], options: any): Promise<string[]>`

This function processes an array of file paths. It accepts a `pathArray` parameter, which is an array of file paths, and an `options` parameter, which is an object containing optional parameters. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of unique file paths.

Usage example:

```typescript
const fileList = await processPathArray(['path/to/file1.txt', 'path/to/file2.txt'], { recursive: false });
console.log(fileList); // array of unique file paths
```

### Potential Improvements

- Add error handling for file operations to provide more informative error messages.
- Implement caching for file contents to improve performance when looking up ignore contents multiple times.
- Add support for additional ignore file types, such as .npmignore or .dockerignore.
- Refactor the code to use async/await syntax consistently for improved readability.
- Add unit tests to ensure the code functions as expected in different scenarios.
