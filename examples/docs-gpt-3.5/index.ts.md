# src/index.ts

## Overview

This code is a command-line tool that scans files and folders to create documentation. It uses the yargs library for command-line argument parsing, the ora library for displaying loading spinners, the chalk library for colored console output, and the node:fs/promises module for file system operations. The code also imports functions from other modules for utility and API calls.

The tool accepts various command-line options such as the path to the file(s) or folder(s) to scan, the output location for the documentation, files or folders to ignore, recursive scanning, the OpenAI model to use, and whether to skip the confirmation prompt. It provides usage examples and help information.

The main functionality of the code involves reading the contents of each file, generating prompt messages for the OpenAI API, making API calls to generate documentation content, and writing the generated content to Markdown files in the specified output location.

## Additional Info

### Installation and Setup

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the code files.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

### Dependencies

This code has the following dependencies:

- yargs: Used for command-line argument parsing.
- ora: Used for displaying loading spinners.
- chalk: Used for colored console output.
- node:fs/promises: Used for file system operations.
- node:path: Used for working with file paths.
- readline: Used for reading user input from the command line.

### Functions

The code defines the following functions:

1. `documentFile(file: string)`: This function reads the contents of a file, generates prompt messages for the OpenAI API, makes an API call to generate documentation content, and writes the generated content to a Markdown file in the specified output location. It returns the response from the OpenAI API.

   Example usage:
   ```typescript
   await documentFile('./path/to/file.js');
   ```

2. `documentFiles(files: Array<string>)`: This function takes an array of file paths, iterates over them, and calls the `documentFile` function for each file. It displays a loading spinner while processing the files and handles any errors that occur.

   Example usage:
   ```typescript
   await documentFiles(['./path/to/file1.js', './path/to/file2.js']);
   ```

### Potential Arguments Against

- The code assumes that the OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable. This may not be suitable for all use cases and could be improved by allowing the API key to be provided as a command-line argument or through a configuration file.
- The code does not handle all possible error scenarios. For example, it does not handle cases where the file read or write operations fail. Adding more robust error handling would improve the reliability of the tool.
- The code does not provide an option to customize the generated Markdown content or template. Adding support for custom templates or allowing users to provide their own Markdown files as templates would enhance the flexibility of the tool.
- The code does not have extensive unit tests or automated tests. Adding more test coverage would improve the code's reliability and make it easier to maintain and refactor in the future.
- The code does not have a built-in mechanism for versioning the generated documentation or tracking changes over time. Adding versioning support or integration with version control systems would be a valuable addition.
